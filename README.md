# Flower-shop-
A flower shop sells flowers and creates custom bouquets. It needs to store information about the flowers: name, color, cost, and orders. When a sale is made, the date, price, quantity, and total amount are recorded. For orders, the customer's name, order details, address, and phone number are stored. With the help of this program, the seller can quickly place and cancel orders.
